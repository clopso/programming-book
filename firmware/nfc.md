# NFC

## What Are NFC Tags?

Near-field communication technology allows two devices to **communicate wirelessly**. The technology can be embedded in a small tag to facilitate data transfer between nearby mobile phones, laptops, tablets, and other electronics.

### History of NFC

NFC technology by the companies Sony and Philips in the early 2000s. It’s based on radio-frequency identification (RFID), which is a **similar technology** that has been in use for some time using radio waves.

The first use of NFC for **contactless payments** was in 1997 when Speedpass could be used to pay for gas at Mobil gas stations via a key ring.

Since then, it has evolved to include payment cards, key fobs, stickers, smartphones, and tags. Its popularity can be attributed to **cutting out the hassle** of swiping or texting to make payments while still offering a high degree of security.

### What is RIFD?

The RIFD technology (radio-frequency identification) is the **predecessor of NFC**. RFID tags are most commonly known for anti-theft systems attached to the more expensive products in stores.

RIFD has been successfully used to **track inventory** in a variety of sectors and industries, e.g., manufacturing, healthcare, automotive, or apparel.

### What is NFC?

NFC is part RFID (radio-frequency identification) and part Bluetooth. Unlike RFID, NFC tags work in **close proximity**, giving users more precision.

NFC also doesn’t require manual device discovery and synchronization as Bluetooth Low Energy does. The biggest difference between RFID and NFC is the **communication method**.

RFID tags have only a one-way communication method, meaning an RFID-enabled item **sends a signal** to an RFID reader.

NFC devices have a **one- and two-way** communication capability, which gives the NFC technology an upper hand in use cases where transactions are dependent on data from two devices (e.g., card payments).

Mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Android Pay, and other contactless payment solutions **are all powered** by NFC technology.

So **in essence**, RFID tags are great for inventory tracking and NFC tags work well for enhanced communication.

### NFC technology has three modes of operation:

* **Card emulation**. This mode enables monetary transactions.
* **Reader/writer.** This mode enables the user to interact with tags.
* **Peer-to-peer**. This mode enables two NFC devices to exchange data.

NFC popularity soared when companies recognized NFC as an enabler of a contactless future. Contactless payments registered a **150% increase** between March 2019 and June 2020 in the US alone, partially caused by the pandemic.

Contactless tech, originally designed to handle **small purchases**, is now one of the most popular mobile payment methods.

Today, there are more than **2 billion NFC-enabled** devices and 20% of the world’s population has access to NFC.

## How do NFC Tags Work?

NFC tags work like any other RFID tag to **communicate over radio waves**. Two devices, the NFC tag and the NFC reader exchange information in NFC data exchange format.

An NFC tag sends radio waves to **activate the antenna** in a receiving device. The recipient validates the information to complete the information exchange.

The technology works over a very short distance, **approximately 4 inches**. NFC tags work without a battery and draw power from another device, e.g., a smartphone.

An NFC reader connects to **only one** NFC tag at a time, minimizing accidental transactions. During NFC payments, encrypted data exchange happens between NFC chips.

Card details can be stored on a smartphone, which then acts like a traditional card. Users can pay without carrying multiple cards in their wallets.

## Business Benefits of Using NFC

### Instant Connection

NFC devices **connect instantly** for data exchange when brought close together.

The small range of NFC chips makes this **technology useful** for payments, identification, access control, ticketing, or any other application requiring near-field data exchange.

### Wireless Exchange

All modern smartphones have NFC modules that connect wirelessly and without an external power source. NFC chips are **passive devices** that are powered by a device that reads them at the moment (this happens through magnetic induction).

### Secure, Standardized, and Regulated Technology

NFC data exchange occurs only between devices in **close proximity**. Nearby connection limited to one device protects the transaction from remote jacking by a hacker.

NFC connections are **regulated by standard protocols** like ISO/IEC 14443 A, ISO/IEC 14443 B, and JIS X6319-4. ECMA International, ETSI, and other authorities make sure that NFC is universally secure and accessible across device vendors.

### No Need for Network Connectivity

NFC tags can work without WiFi, 4G, 5G, or LTE connectivity. This means users can pay, transfer data, access areas, and use NFC-enabled services even while they’re **disconnected from the internet**.

For example, retail outlets and small businesses use NFC-enabled POS systems to process payments. Hotels use NFC keycards that work even in locations with a weak WiFi signal. Customers can use all the services **without worrying** about mobile data charges or signal unavailability.

### Convenient and affordable technology

NFC tags are an **easy and affordable technology** that can help in digital transformation, contactless payments, access control, and identification can significantly improve customer and employee experience in their daily activities.

For example, you can use NFC to enable contactless access to your gym, health center, or office. Users can download your custom mobile app to pay for their membership and then use the smartphone to access the facility. In the post-COVID world, NFCs with digital tokens **help any customer-facing business** remain contactless.

### Reduced Carbon Footprint

NFC is an eco-friendly solution that can minimize the carbon footprint of any business. Recyclable NFC tags made using paper **reduce the use of plastic** for access cards.

## How Businesses Are Using NFC Tags?

NFC offers **many opportunities** for companies that want to digitize experiences or facilitate access. Businesses all over the globe are using NFC for several use cases and applications.

### Contactless Payments

Contactless payments are the **most prominent** use case for NFC technology. NFC makes transactions easy, secure, and fast. NFC-enabled devices have fueled the contactless payment revolution, especially post-COVID.

Consumers don’t need to input anything extra (PIN or signatures) for small transactions. Plus, NFC is a **more secure way to pay**, transactions happen instantly and users don't have to hand over their card with sensitive information on it.

Google Pay is a prominent example of a **contactless payment** solution based on NFC. The app powers contactless payments to millions of consumers globally via their smartphones.

### Ticketing

An NFC-enabled smartphone **can be used** as a ticket for concerts, movie shows, or even transit. Many businesses, operators, and even public transportation services have added NFC technology to their ticketing operations.

NFC-enabled devices work by **generating digital access tokens** that people use to get on a bus or metro without needing to top up their SmarTrip cards. Payments will be made automatically using Apple Pay or Google Pay.

### Identification and Access Control

NFC can be used to **identify team members** and people who access select areas or floors. People can use their smartphones to open doors at the office, no separate access card is necessary for identification and access control.

### Product Status and Maintenance

NXP, a manufacturer of semiconductors, has announced the launch of a **new line of NFC-integrated circuits**. The circuits provide a tamper-detection and condition-monitoring feature, which opens the doors to a host of new use cases for NFC tags.

The NFC circuits can be included in anti-tampering systems to enable the detection of **tampering incidents** on sealed products.

When the cap is tampered with, the tag sends a signal to the chip’s memory, **recording the breaking of the seal**. The customer can later view the information via a smartphone by scanning the product.

Another type of NXP-made circuit comes with condition-monitoring features that can **detect moisture** or fill levels in bottles and containers. To see a product’s fill level, you simply scan the tag with your phone.

### Checkpoint and Player Tracking in Sports Events

NFC technology has the potential to **revolutionize** the way we approach orienteering, a sport that is still heavily reliant on expensive tracking and navigation systems.

Many participants in events across the world still rely on a pen-and-paper method to mark checkpoints and landmarks, which can be **inefficient and problematic** for referees to verify during events (especially multi-part events).

A mobile app with NFC tags and an automated verification system could greatly improve the checkpoint verification process. Participants could use their smartphones to tap NFC tags placed at each checkpoint, which would automatically record their progress and **ensure accurate results**.

This would not only streamline the orienteering process but also provide a **more accessible** and affordable option for athletes and event organizers.

### Trail Completion and Summit Confirmation

NFC tags and companion mobile applications can be used to **create a verifiable repository** of completed trails and summits.

Checking in at historical locations or scenic paths and mountaintops could be a **motivational incentive** for younger generations with personalized digital collections that can be shared with others.

## NFC technology security issues

### Eavesdropping

It is possible for a fraudster to “**listen in**” on NFC transactions. However, the methods that hinder this include proximity since the devices have to be close to send signals. Secondly, the secure channels used for NFC payments are encrypted, and only authorized devices can decode payment information.

### Data corruption, manipulation, or interception

Fraudsters can manipulate, interfere with, or intercept **data being sent** to a reader, making it useless or corrupted when it’s received. When secure channels are used for communications, this cannot occur. Some NFC devices are equipped to listen to these attacks and prevent them from happening.

### Theft

If a phone is stolen, it can be used to make purchases. Users of smart devices should make sure they’ve installed passwords, Face IDs, fingerprint identification, or another **form of security** so that the device can’t be accessed by an unauthorized person.
