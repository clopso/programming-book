# FreeRTOS

The FreeRTOS kernel was originally developed by Richard Barry around 2003 and was later developed and maintained by Barry's company, Real Time Engineers Ltd.

In 2017, the firm passed stewardship of the FreeRTOS project to Amazon Web Services (AWS). Barry continues to work on FreeRTOS as part of an AWS team.
