# Connections

The most common way to achieve two-way communication in Bluetooth Low Energy is to use connections.

In addition, a connection grants you benefits like higher data throughput, mechanisms to handle packet loss, and added security.

When you enter a connection in Bluetooth LE, a set of connection parameters is revealed.

For a simple application, the default connection parameters may work perfectly fine, but you can also tweak these parameters to best suit your application, to give you the lowest power usage, or to achieve the throughput that you need.
