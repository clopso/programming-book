# ATT & GATT

After establishing a connection, there is a need for **bidirectional data exchange**. This requires specific data structures and protocols tailored for these purposes.

The Attribute protocol (ATT) layer, and the Generic Attribute protocol (GATT) layer right above it, define how data is **represented and exchanged** between Bluetooth LE devices.

## The Attribute Protocol

The ATT layer is the basis on which data is transmitted, received, and handled in the **connection phase** of Bluetooth LE devices. It is based on a client-server architecture.

The client and server roles defined in this layer are assigned **independently** from the peripheral and central roles defined in the GAP layer.

In most cases, the peripheral will be a server since the peripheral is the device that **acquires** data and holds it.

* **GATT server:** A device that stores data and provides methods for the GATT client to access the data.
* **GATT client:** A device that accesses the data on the GATT server, through specific GATT operations.

The ATT layer defines a data structure called the **attribute**, which is used by the GATT server to store data. The server can hold a number of different attributes at the same time.

* **Attribute**: A standardized data representation format defined by the ATT protocol

## The Generic Attribute Profile

The Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) layer sits **directly** on top of the ATT layer and builds on it by hierarchically classifying attributes into profiles, services, and characteristics.

### Profiles, services, and characteristics

Two attributes together form what’s called a _**characteristic**_. All characteristics are enclosed in what’s called a _**service**_. Services usually contain multiple characteristics.

Before a client starts interacting with a server, the client is **not aware** of the nature of the attributes stored on that server. Therefore, the client first performs what’s called Service Discovery where it inquires from the server about the attributes.
