# Peripherals

Peripherals in a microcontroller refer to the **additional hardware** components integrated into the microcontroller chip that enables it to interact with the external world.

These peripherals offload work from the microprocessor, **allowing** it to focus on other tasks.

**Examples of peripherals** in a microcontroller include GPIOs, I2C, SPI, UART, timers, USB, DAC, RTC, and more.

These peripherals provide the microcontroller with the ability to **communicate with external** sensors, switches, and other devices, making them essential for a wide variety of applications.

In summary, peripherals in a microcontroller are crucial for enabling the microcontroller to interface with the **external world**, and they encompass a wide range of functions such as input/output, communication, timing, and control.
